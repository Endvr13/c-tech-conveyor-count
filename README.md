# Inventory Tracker (Front-End)

This React Remix application provides a user interface for tracking inventory items as the pass through a computer vision camera on a conveyor belt.

## Features

- **Real-time Inventory Count:** Displays a live count of items detected by the camera.
- **Historical Log:** Records a timestamped log of item detections for reference.

## Prerequisites

- **Back-end API:** Assumes the existence of a back-end APU to handle:

  - Communication with the computer vision system
  - Storage of inventory logs

- **Node.js and npm:** For package management.
